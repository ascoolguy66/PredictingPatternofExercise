# Predicting Pattern of Exercise
<b> Predicting Pattern of Exercise using Machine Learning Techniques </b>

In this project, we will use data collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

This project aims to predict in which manner participants completed a single exercise, based on recordings provided by accelerometers attached to 4 measurement points on the body. Six male participants aged 20-28 were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in one correct, and 4 incorrect fashions. Specifically, the exercises were performed:
* Exactly according to the specification (Class A);
* Throwing elbows to the front (Class B);
* Lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C);
* Lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D); and
* Throwing the hips to the front (Class E).
